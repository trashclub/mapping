A few mapping experiments looking at waste-adjacent datasets (documented in the Data Library)

## August 18, 2020

A very quick map produced from NYC Open Data on food scrap drop-off sites:

**Ways to continue to improve this map and the related datasets:**

Easy to imagine how it may be made more interesting with added context, annotations, additional datasets, etc.

* Add in elected officials to the geographic dataset, export as geojson
* Add column to capture status (open / closed) to Food Scrap Drop-offs dataset (especially given new conditions post-COVID)
* Annotate the map with relevant council members, interactive version could do this by tooltip.
